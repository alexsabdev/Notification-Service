=======================
## Description
notification-service - angular.js service providing notifications using Bootstrap 3 styles with smooth css transition animation. 
* author alexsabdev (alexsabdev@gmail.com)
* version v1.0.0
* link https://github.com/alexsabdev/notification-service.git
* dependencies: no dependencies, it works as a separate module, ready to be injected

## Features
* tt displays notifications as overlay in fromt of the page;
* the notifications have a title and a body;
* they have different appearance depending on a category;
* max 5 notifications are displayed at the same time;
* when the limit is reached, the oldest notification temporary gets off from screen and the latest pops up and after that gets back when there's a free spot;
* created notifications are closable by clicking;
* they are also closed automatically after 90 seconds.

## How to use:
* Simply inject the notification-service to your app module:
```bash
var app = angular.module('myApp', ['notification-service']);
...
```
* And inject its service called 'Notification' to the app controller:
```bash
...
app.controller('AppController', ['$scope', 'Notification', function($scope, Notification){...}]);
```
* You need also to download notification-service.js and notification-service-styles.css from the dist folder (or their minified versions). Don't forget to link downloaded files to your html/template:
```bash
...
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/notification-service-styles.css">
...
<script src="scripts/notification-service.js"></script>
...
```
* After injection, when you need to show a notification, within the app controller call:
```bash
...
Notification.notify(note);
...
```
where note is a notification object consisting of following properties. All of them are required.
<br />   id: The id of the notification message.
<br />   category: Category of the notification message. Possible categories are “info”, “warning” and “error”.
<br />   header: Header of the notification.
