## How to use:
* Simply inject the notification-service to your app module:

...
```
* And inject its service called 'Notification' to the app controller:
```bash
...
app.controller('AppController', ['$scope', 'Notification', function($scope, Notification){...}]);
```
* You need also to download notification-service.js and notification-service-styles.css from the dist folder (or their minified versions). Don't forget to link downloaded files to your html/template:
```bash
...
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/notification-service-styles.css">
...
<script src="scripts/notification-service.js"></script>
...
```
* After injection, when you need to show a notification, within the app controller call:
```bash
...
Notification.notify(note);
...
```
where note is a notification object consisting of following properties. All of them are required.
<br />   id: The id of the notification message.
<br />   category: Category of the notification message. Possible categories are “info”, “warning” and “error”.
<br />   header: Header of the notification.
